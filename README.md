# Linked List Implementation
C++ LinkedList class

This implementation is a doubly linked list. It uses templates to allow the linked list to hold different data types as values.

The class declaration and defintions are in the header file, LinkedList.h

The testing exists in main.cpp

In addition to a LinkedList class, a ListNode class is also defined to keep track of the data and pointers in each node of the linked list
